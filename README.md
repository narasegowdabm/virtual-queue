# Virtual Queue Management

The Virtual Queue Management System is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that allows users to manage appointments with doctors, view virtual queues, and facilitate real time communication between patients and healthcare providers using websockets.

## Problem Statement
Long wait times in queues at hospitals and public service providers are a common problem. Patients often spend significant amounts of time waiting for their turn to see a doctor, leading to frustration, inconvenience, and sometimes delays in receiving necessary medical care.

The Virtual Queue Management System seeks to alleviate this problem by digitizing the appointment booking process and implementing a virtual queue system. By allowing patients to book appointments online and providing real-time updates on their queue status, this system aims to reduce physical wait times and improve the overall patient experience.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
- **Doctor Management**: Admin users can add, edit, and remove doctors from the system.
- **Appointment Booking**: Patients can book appointments with doctors based on availability.
- **Virtual Queue**: Real-time virtual queue management for doctors, visible to both admin and patients.
- **WebSocket Integration**: WebSocket support for real-time updates to the virtual queue.
